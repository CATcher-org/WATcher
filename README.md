# WATcher

**WAT**cher is a sister application to CATcher to be used to monitor GitHub activities (e.g., workload distribution among team members) of software projects in a visual way. WATcher targets small teams (e.g., a team project in a Software Engineering course). WATcher is particularly useful for student projects due to small team/project size, and the need for close monitoring by project members as well as teachers.
